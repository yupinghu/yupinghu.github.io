Why is it that people offer to reveal their entire lives

<strong>Ancient History</strong><br>
Before high school, there's little to tell. The only thing I can
remember with any real clarity is my two years (7-8 grade) at <a
href="http://www.horacemann.pvt.k12.ny.us/">Horace Mann</a>. In some
ways, I wish I had stayed there for high school as well.
