		<p><strong>Who is yph, anyway?</strong><br>
		I'm the guy in the picture at right. I don't usually carry a
		wooden sword -- that was borrowed from my friend <a
		href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~kovar/">Lucas Kovar</a> when we were
		in Los Alamos for the summer of 1999. While there are newer pictures
		of me out there, I will probably never bother to put it
		here. Webpages like this are kind of an anachronism these days.<br>
		Case in point: while I used to intend to add more to <a
		href="bio.html">my bio</a>, there's a good chance I never will.<br>
		I've been remiss in my collection of good <a
		href="quotes.html">quotes</a> since I finished school. I suppose
		it's harder to quote folks when a large amount of my interaction is
		no longer electronic and therefore fully logged.
		</p>
		<p><strong>What does yph do?</strong><br>
		I spent five and a half years at <a
		href="http://www.stanford.edu/">Stanford University</a> studying
		computer science, and they gave me two fancy pieces of paper to
		prove it. I didn't actually get the MS until a few years after I
		left, primarily because I was a slacker in completing the
		paperwork, and it just didn't seem to matter. After all, the degrees
		are just gathering dust on my shelf. When I get a real stereo I
		guess I have a balanced pair to support the speakers.<br>
		Since school, I've written lots of software at lots of places,
		such as lots of the server code for
		<a href="http://www.swtor.com/">one of the largest games ever
		made</a>, as well as some sync code that recently made its way into
		<a
		href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.gm">an
		Android app that lots of people use</a>.<br>
		I used to think I really wanted to make games, but recently I
		realized that the fact that they were games is the least important
		part of why I liked the jobs that I've liked, so now I just build
		useful infrastructure for nicer, smarter people than myself.<br>
		When I'm not at work, I used to spend a lot of time <a
		href="http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/">killing monsters for their
		treasure</a> and sometimes <a
		href="http://www.starcraft2.com/">hungering for battle</a>. These
		days though, there's a small child that demands all my
		extracurricular attention, and I gladly give it to him.
		</p>
		<p><strong>What is yph up to right now?</strong><br>
		You can <a href="https://plus.google.com/+YuPingHu/posts">find
		me on Google+</a>, although I've decided that social networks are
		dumb so I post on there less than I used to. Still, it's a useful
		way to contact me and see infrequent private posts.
