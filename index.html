			Webpages like this are an anachronism these days, supplanted by social media and such:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/+YuPingHu/">Google+</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yu-ping-hu-1621051">LinkedIn</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lVJKFF1WEtdeIvBR940wE_IzIapgAfqxrYuXuWdIz2o/edit?usp=sharing">Resume</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			I used to be a big believer in the power of the web and the internet to help people form
			communities, but then I realized that the ad-supported model subverts the incentives of
			the various sites and that the term "social media" is only half right. So despite it
			being the first link above, I don't actually use Google+ (and certainly not Facebook)
			but it's still a handy way to find me and get some info about me. The other two links
			are only there because I have to feed my family so it kinda matters to keep those up to
			date.
		</p>
		<p>
			It'd be nice if, by the time my kids are old enough to use the web, my old naive hopes
			about how the internet can be used to bring people together in a meaningful way come to
			pass. It'd be nicer if I contributed to that vision in some small way.
