      Webpages like this are an anachronism these days, supplanted by social media and such. I used
      to be a big believer in the power of the internet to help people form communities, but recent
      history taught us that the ad-supported business model of much of Big Tech leads to
      problematic and evil behaviors for those companies. At the same time, the term "social media"
      is at best half right: it's pretty isolating. So I don't have any personal profiles to link
      here, and only have the following links because I have to feed my family and therefore it's
      helpful for these to be kept up to date:

    <ul>
			<li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yu-ping-hu-1621051">LinkedIn</a></li>
			<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lVJKFF1WEtdeIvBR940wE_IzIapgAfqxrYuXuWdIz2o/edit?usp=sharing">Resume</a></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			It'd be nice if, by the time my kids are old enough to use the web, my old naive hopes
			about how the internet can be used to bring people together in a meaningful way come to
			pass. It'd be nicer if I contributed to that vision in some small way.
