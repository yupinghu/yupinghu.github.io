go so long without a release<br>

that?<br>

(12:09:56 PM) eeyore: yes, I only allow myself to ejaculate when the

<tt>(1:36:06 PM) eeyore: as I am playing with the cat and trying to get her
used to the house I realize that I'm following basically the same
procedure as I would with a kidnap victim that I was trying to turn<br>
(1:36:20 PM) eeyore: she has her own room with a bed and a toilet and
some things to idly spend her time with<br>
(1:36:35 PM) eeyore: I come in and visit for a while every once in a
while and we spend time together getting her used to me<br>
(1:36:43 PM) eeyore: then I leave and close the door and come back later<br>
(1:36:50 PM) eeyore: slowly she warms up to me and her fear diminishes<br>
(1:37:01 PM) eeyore: and then one day I let her out and she kills me in
my sleep and runs away<br></tt>

somebody noticed on google alerts a blog post by somebody who had had a
phone interview, and it turned out to be the same guy<br>
(11:03:27 AM) eeyore: and from his blog we gathered that he's into
polyamory and BDSM<br>
(11:03:50 AM) eeyore: so, yeah, why he didn't put that on his resume

    Reeves talked a lot about a device called the Galvactator,
a nuclear powered death ray.  Well, actually the Galvactator is just
this little black glove with a  light on it that measures the moiture
coming from the sweat glands in the palm (if the glove had deathray
functionality it was not mentioned.)

NAME
     yph - an arbitrary insult generator
SYNOPSIS
     yph
DESCRIPTION
     Yph is an arbitrary insult generator.  Under conditions of little
     sleep, sharp performance increase is noticible.  Thinks it is the shit
     because it is a 107 TA.  Will make obnoxious zwrites with little
     provocation.     
BUGS
     Email bug reports to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Be sure
     to  include  the  word  ``yph'' somewhere in the ``Subject:''
     field.  A better solution is to simply run ``nkill yph -9 -all''.

it sucked.  (hmmm. really hope that i didn't fail.   a distinct
possibility.

hmmmm.  i guess that one "f" will just make the rest of my grades look
